# Machine Coding Practice

## Overview
This repository contains hands-on practice exercises for **machine coding interview rounds**, covering both **frontend** and **backend** implementations. The goal is to focus on clean architecture, readable code, and practical problem-solving under time constraints.

The repository is structured to mirror real-world application development, making it suitable for interview preparation and technical discussions.

## Folder Structure
```
